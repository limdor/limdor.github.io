All my work has been always around C++. First working in real-time rendering and later in embedded software. Currently I'm leading a team at BMW developing software for the next generation of autonomous driving.
I like research, software development and teaching, but what I like the most it the get the best out of people.
I have the honor to be BMW's representative at the ISO C++ standard committee and MISRA C++ meetings.
