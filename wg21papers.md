This is the list of papers to improve C++ that I am involved as an author:

| Paper | Authors | Github Issue | Status |
|----|----|----|
| [Allow `[[nodiscard]]` in type alias declarations](https://wg21.link/p3245) | Xavier Bonaventura | [Issue](https://wg21.link/p3245/github) | Rejected (I have no plan to continue purusing this paper. After initial feedback it was seen that cost/benefit is not worth it.) |
| [mdspan.at()](https://wg21.link/p3383) | Stephan Lachnit<br>Xavier Bonaventura | [Issue](https://wg21.link/p3383/github) | Approved for C++26 |
